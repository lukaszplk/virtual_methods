three for triangle for each triangle's side

Then u can specify how many calc u want to do. There are p for perimeter and a for area.

U are suppose to choose right operation and enter for which figure do u want do calcs. (indexing since 1)

For example:  
Number of figures: 2  
c  
2  
t  
1 2 3  
3  
p  
1  
output: 12.56  
p  
2  
output: 6.00  
a
